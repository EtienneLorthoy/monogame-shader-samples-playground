## Description

All is in the title, this repos is for having handy and ready to use HLSL Shaders to be directly used in a Monogame project. Target Monogame version : 3.8.1.303

The aim here is being able to copy/past an entire playground class, and past it in a Monogame project and have it working with little to no modification. So you can prototype quickly some nice or specific rendering method.

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), with [Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed on your computer or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Make sure to follow those [Monogame install instructions](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html) too. You can skip the install of MonoGame extension and MGCB Editor.
